<h3 id="options">Monitoring results by HTTP Response code</h3>

The monitoring results for each HTTP response code can be configured via the `--status` option, but if it they are not configured, the monitoring results are as below.

| HTTP Response Code | Monitoring Results |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 100 level          | OK                 |
| 200 level          | OK                 |
| 300 level          | OK                 |
| 400 level          | WARNING            |
| Other              | CRITICAL           |

- The monitoring results for each HTTP response code can be configured via the `--status` option in the format `key-value`.
- HTTP response codes may also be assigned to a range, such as `200-404`.

<h2 id="config">Example configurations</h2>

To monitor `https://mackerel.io/`, use the following configuration.

```
[plugin.checks.https-mackerelio]
command = ["check-http", "-u", "https://mackerel.io"]
```

To set the monitoring result for the HTTP response of 404 to `OK`, use the following configuration.

```
[plugin.checks.https-mackerelio]
command = ["check-http", "-u", "https://mackerel.io", "--status", "404=OK"]
```

It is also possible to designate the HTTP status code in the format `200-404`.

```
[plugin.checks.https-mackerelio]
command = ["check-http", "-u", "https://mackerel.io", "--status", "200-404=OK"]
```

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

Usually, for monitoring Internet-exposed endpoints as in the [Example configurations](##Example configurations), [External URL Monitoring] (https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/external-monitoring) via the main Mackerel service is recommended.

Please use the check-http plugin as an internal monitoring method for monitoring internal APIs, etc., on the same network which cannot be monitored directly from the Internet.

It can also be used as a substitute to monitor URLs which require client authentication, etc., that are not compatible with external URL monitoring.
