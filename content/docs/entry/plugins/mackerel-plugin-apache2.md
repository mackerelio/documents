<h2 id="config">Example configuration</h2>

```
[plugin.metrics.apache2]
command = ["mackerel-plugin-apache2", "-p", "1080"]
```

To check the above settings manually, you can execute the following at the terminal.

```
mackerel-plugin-apache2 -p 1080
```

<h2 id="config-apache">Configuration for Apache</h2>

Make sure that the Apache Status module (mod_status) is enabled in order to use mackerel-plugin-apache2.

The following configuration assumes publication at `http://127.0.0.1:1080/server-status`.

```
ExtendedStatus On
<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:1080>
  <Location /server-status>
    SetHandler server-status
    Order deny,allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from localhost
  </Location>
</VirtualHost>
```

<h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</h2>

### Cannot get metrics

If you are unable to obtain a metric after setting up the plugin, it may be due to a configuration that has not been reflected or an incorrect setting of the Status module on the Apache side. Please check the following points.

- Whether or not mackerel-agent has been restarted after the plugin has been configured.
  - Restarting mackerel-agent is required for the settings to take effect.
- Can you connect to the server-status endpoint with the curl command?
  - Please confirm that you can receive the HTTP 200 OK response with the following command when configured as shown in the configuration example.

    ```
    curl http://127.0.0.1:1080/server-status
    ```

  - If you have a `http` to `https` redirect configured in mod_rewrite, the plugin will not track the redirect; the Status module endpoint should be excluded from the redirect.
  - If you cannot get the results of the Status module with the curl command, it may be because it has been incorrectly configured or Apache has not been restarted.
