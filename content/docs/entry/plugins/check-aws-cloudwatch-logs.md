check-aws-cloudwatch-logs is a plugin that monitors log group of CloudWatch Logs. This plugin will generate an alert when it detects logs that match the conditions described in the CloudWatch Logs [filter and pattern syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html). This plugin requires configuration to run FilterLogEvents API of CloudWatch Logs. See [Authentication and required policies](#policy) for more information.

<h2 id="specification">Monitoring Specifications</h2>

check-aws-cloudwatch-logs monitors logs up to 1 minute before the current time when first run.

- ex. 1st run at 12:00
  - Target is 11:59 (startTime) to 12:00 (endTime)

The endTime is recorded in [State file](#state-file) each time it is executed, and from the second time onward, the log is monitored from the current time to that time.

- ex. 1st run 12:00, 2nd run 12:05
  - Target is 12:00 (startTime) to 12:05 (endTime)

If more than one hour has passed since the last execution, logs up to 1 minute before the current time will be monitored as in the case of the first execution.

<h2 id="config">Example configurations</h2>

The following is a configuration for detecting logs containing the word "Error" in the CloudWatch Logs log group `/aws/lambda/sample_log_group`.

```
[plugin.checks.aws-cloudwatch-logs-sample]
command = ["check-aws-cloudwatch-logs", "--log-group-name", "/aws/lambda/sample_log_group", "--pattern", "Error"]
env = { AWS_REGION = "ap-northeast-1" }
```

<h3 id="pattern">How to write --pattern option</h3>

--pattern is written in CloudWatch Logs filter and pattern syntax. Please refer to the AWS documentation for details on how to specify.

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html:embed:cite]

Below are some examples of describing conditional specifications.

#### Specify a single string

The following matches logs containing “ERROR”.

```
"--pattern", "ERROR"
```

#### Specify AND condition

To specify AND conditions, separate strings with a space. The following matches logs containing “ERROR” and “ARGUMENTS”.

```
"--pattern", "ERROR ARGUMENTS"
```

#### Specify OR condition

To specify an OR condition, prefix the string with `?` at the beginning of the string. The following matches logs containing "ERROR" or "ARGUMENTS".

```
"--pattern", "?ERROR ?ARGUMENTS"
```

#### Specify strings to exclude

If you want to exclude a specific string, put `-` at the beginning of the string you want to exclude. The following matches logs that contain "ERROR" and do not contain "ARGUMENTS".

```
"--pattern", "ERROR -ARGUMENTS"
```

A leading space is required to specify only the strings to be excluded. The following matches logs that do not include “ARGUMENTS”.

```
"--pattern", " -ARGUMENTS"
```

#### Specify regular expressions

To specify a filter pattern with a regular expression, enclose the regular expression pattern with `%`. Supported regular expressions depend on the CloudWatch Logs filter pattern specification.

```
"--pattern", "%regular expression%"
```

#### Specify JSON format

The filter pattern for JSON logs is `{ $. key = \“value\”}`. The following matches a JSON log with key “level” and value “ERROR”.

```
"--pattern", "{ $.level = \"ERROR\" }"
```

If the specified string of --pattern is enclosed in `'` (single quotation mark), no escaping of `"` is required.

```
"--pattern", '{ $.level = "ERROR" }'
```

#### Specify strings containing symbols or spaces

To specify a string containing symbols or spaces, enclose the string in `\"`. If the specified string of --pattern is enclosed in `'` (single quotation mark), no escaping of `"` is required.

The following matches logs containing “level: ERROR”.

```
"--pattern", "\"level: ERROR\""
```

```
"--pattern", '"level: ERROR"'
```

The following matches logs that do not contain “level: ERROR”.

```
"--pattern", " -\"level: ERROR\""
```

```
"--pattern", ' -"level: ERROR"'
```

<h3 id="region">How to specify a region</h3>

The region is specified by the check monitoring environment variable, not by a plugin option. Named profiles by the AWS_PROFILE environment variable are also supported.

```
env = { AWS_REGION = "ap-northeast-1" }
```

<h3 id="state-file">About State file</h3>

If the `--state-dir` option is not specified, the State file will be saved in the following directory in the format `{monitoring log group name}-<hash string>.json`.

- When run via mackerel-agent
  - `/var/tmp/mackerel-agent/check-cloudwatch-logs`
- When run manually
  - `/tmp/check-cloudwatch-logs`

<h2 id="policy">Authentication and required policies</h2>

check-aws-cloudwatch-logs uses the FilterLogEvents API of CloudWatch Logs. Please check that the credentials of the IAM user/role are available to perform the following actions on the monitored log groups.

- `logs:FilterLogEvents`

The following methods are supported for setting credentials.

- Use of instance profiles (when monitoring from EC2 instances)
- Use named profiles in the AWS_PROFILE environment variable
- Specify the environment variable `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` directly with `env = {}` in mackerel-agent.conf.

<h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</h2>

### `Unknown: command timed out' occurred

A log stream with a high flow rate or a log group with a large number of streams may cause the plugin execution to time out. You can extend the timeout by specifying `timeout_seconds` in the plugin configuration. However, it must be specified so that it does not exceed `check_interval`. For more information, see [Adding monitors for script checks](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/custom-checks).

If the log volume is large, a timeout may occur. If timeouts occur frequently, reduce the amount of log volume or sample the logs. If this is difficult, consider using [check-aws-cloudwatch-logs-insights](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/plugins/check-aws-cloudwatch-logs-insights), which also supports monitoring of large log groups.
