<h2 id="config">Example configuration</h2>

To monitor the availability of the W3SVC service, configure as follows.

```
[plugin.checks.ntsvc_w3svc]
command = ["check-ntservice", "--service-name", "W3SVC"]
```

To check the above settings manually, you can run the following at the command prompt.

- The path to the command must be included in the PATH system environment variable.

```
check-ntservice --service-name W3SVC
```

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

- You can confirm the service name in advance by executing the command with the `--list-service` option.

```
check-ntservice --list-service
```

<h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting</h2>

### Unintended service outages are detected.

Because check-ntservice checks for services containing the string specified in the `--service-name` option, it may detect unintended service outages.

In this case, use the `--exact` or `--exclude-service` option to identify the target service or exclude services that contain unnecessary strings.

For example, if you have two services running, `foo` and `foobar`, and you want to monitor `foo`, you can simply specify the `--exact` option as follows.

```
[plugin.checks.ntsvc_w3svc]
command = ["check-ntservice", "--service-name", "foo", "--exact"]
```

It may also be excluded by specifying the `--exclude-service` option as follows.

```
[plugin.checks.ntsvc_w3svc]
command = ["check-ntservice", "--service-name", "foo", "--exclude-service", "foobar"]
```

### When the specified service is not found, an UNKNOWN alert is emitted.

An UNKNOWN alert with the message `service does not exist.` is caused when a service specified in the condition is not found.

Please check whether the correct service name is specified or not by utilizing the `--list-service` option.
