#### Options

|Configuration item|Description|
|-----|-----|
|An alert will be generated if the response time is over the threshold|This External URL monitoring rule can be applied to any service to visualize its response time in the form of a service metrics graph. You can also monitor its response time by specifying a threshold value. <br>`Warning / Critical Threshold`: Even if a value greater than 15 seconds (15,000 ms) is specified, a timeout will occur when there is no response after 15 seconds. <br> `Duration`: This monitors the average value of the response times generated within the past 1 to 10 minutes as specified.|
|Max number of attempts before an alert is triggered|An alert is triggered when an abnormal event equivalent to a Warning/Critical alert occurs a specified number of times consecutively.|
|Notification interval|If there has been no change to the alert’s condition, even if the designated time is surpassed, the notification will be sent again.|
|HTTP Request Header|The HTTP Request Header can be specified. If User-Agent is not specified, `User-Agent: mackerel-http-checker/x.y.z` will be sent (`x.y.z` means version number). The default setting for the `Cache-Control` header is `no-cache`.|
|Request body|Make http request with specified request body.|
|Status Code Check|An alert is generated if the status code is not the specified code.|
|Response Body Check|The response body will be checked to make sure a designated string is included. If one is not included, a notification will be sent.|
|Certification expiration date monitoring|The SSL certificate’s expiration date will be monitored. An alert will be sent when the number of remaining days before the expiration date falls below the threshold.|
|Do not perform certificate verification when requests are made|You can monitor without verifying the certificate when monitoring a server with a self-signed certificate.|
|Redirect according to response header|Assess the redirected response as a result.|

## About External URL monitor specs

* Check intervals are fixed at 1 minute

    * If the status code is in the 4xx or 5xx range, or if it is a code other than the one specified in the status code check (optional setting)
    * a 15-second timeout 
    * an invalid SSL certificate  
    * When response time exceeds the threshold (optional setting)
    * When a designated string isn’t included in the response body (optional setting)
    * When the number of remaining days before the SSL certificate expiration date falls below the threshold (optional setting)
* 2xx responses are recognized as normal and not as an error
* Behavior regarding the redirect follow can be changed in settings
   * If not followed, 3xx responses will be recognized as normal and not as an error
   * If followed, the redirect will occur according to the response header
     * Three or more redirects will result in an error and an alert notification will be issued
     * In cases where cookies are received from the target URL that is being monitored (set-cookie), the request sent to the redirection destination page will include the cookie information received.
