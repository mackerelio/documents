Mackerel supports obtaining and monitoring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</a> metrics in AWS Integration. When integrating with AWS Integration, billable targets are determined using the conversion 1 Instance = 1 Standard Host. AWS integration and mackerel-agent can also be used together. In such a case, system metrics and custom metrics will be integrated as one host (no duplicate charges will be made).

Please refer to the following page for AWS Integration configuration methods and a list of supported AWS services.  <br>
<a href="https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/integrations/aws">AWS Integration</a>

## Obtaining metrics

The metrics obtainable with AWS Integrationâ€™s EC2 support are as follows. For `Metric` explanations, refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html" target="_blank">AWS help page</a>.

The maximum number of metrics obtainable is 21.

<h3 id="notes">Precautions</h2>

Among the graphs/metrics obtainable with AWS Integration, metrics included in the following graph are usually obtained in 5 minute intervals.

* CPU
* CPU Credit
* Disk OPS
* Disk IO
* Network Traffic
* Network Packets
* EBS Operation
* EBS Bytes Used
* EBS Burst Bucket Balance

By enabling <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/manage-detailed-monitoring.html">detailed monitoring</a>, the metrics in the graph below will be obtained in 1-minute intervals.

* CPU
* Disk OPS
* Disk IO
* Network Traffic
* EBS Operation
* EBS Bytes Used

This is specified by the AWS CloudWatch API.

## Using with mackerel-agent 

If mackerel-agent has already been installed on the target EC2 instance, host information from Mackerel will automatically be integrated and registered as one host. It will not be counted twice as a billable host.

If you prefer a more detailed style of monitoring with AWS Integration, we recommend installing mackerel-agent for EC2.
