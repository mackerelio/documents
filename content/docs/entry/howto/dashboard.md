After you’ve placed your widgets, if you want to edit the contents or delete a widget, use the icons displayed in the upper right corner of each widget. You can rearrange and resize widgets by dragging and dropping. You can also duplicate a widget by dragging and dropping while pressing the Alt (option) key.

## Precautions
- There is limit on the maximum number of custom dashboards that can exist per organization (100 for the Standard plan). Check the number of custom dashboards that you can create in your organization [here](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=plan).
- If your paid plan is downgraded to the free plan, any custom dashboards exceeding the limit will become unavailable but will not be deleted.
