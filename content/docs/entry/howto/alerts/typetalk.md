##Optional function: Prefix

With Typetalk, you can set custom prefixes to correlate with alert statuses. (If this is not configured, prefixes will not appear with alerts.)

When setting up the channel, set a prefix for each status that is easy to understand such as a happy emoji, sad emoji, or anything of your choosing.
