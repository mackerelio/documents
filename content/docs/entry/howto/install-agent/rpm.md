Execute the following command:

```
curl -fsSL https://mackerel.io/file/script/setup-all-yum-v2.sh | MACKEREL_APIKEY='<YOUR_API_KEY>' sh
```

You can obtain the API key from the [API tab on your organization's page](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=apikeys). Keep in mind this key is used to identify your organization, so we strongly advise not sharing it with others.

Updates can be performed using the `yum` command.

```
sudo yum update mackerel-agent
```

To install mackerel-agent with `rpm` run the following command:

```
sudo rpm -ivh https://mackerel.io/file/agent/rpm/mackerel-agent-latest.noarch.rpm
```

To update Mackerel-agent with `rpm` run the following command:

```

```
apikey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

You can obtain the API key from the [API tab on your organization's page](https://mackerel.io/my?tab=apikeys). Keep in mind this key is used to identify your organization, so we strongly advise not sharing it with others.
