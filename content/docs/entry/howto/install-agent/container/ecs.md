This document details the setup process for mackerel-container-agent on Amazon ECS.

## Operating conditions

The following conditions must be met in order to run mackerel-container-agent.

- When using an EC2 launch type
   - Amazon ECS Container Agent version 1.26.1 or later
- When using a Fargate launch type
   - AWS Fargate platform version 1.3.0 or later

If you encounter a problem with the operation of mackerel-container-agent, please make sure that your environment meets these requirements.

## Point to note regarding billing

For every one task, a micro host will be registered in Mackerel. Please note that charges will occur if using a paid plan. For more details, refer to [FAQ Â· Calculating the number of hosts](https://support.mackerel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039702912).

## Add containers to the task definitions

Add the mackerel-container-agent container to the task definition that you want to monitor.
Add the mackerel-container-agent with the following configuration from the task definition's 'Add container' option.

| Item | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| container name| mackerel-container-agent |
| image|  mackerel/mackerel-container-agent:latest |
| memory limit| hard limit: 0.125 GB |
| environment variable (key: value) | MACKEREL_CONTAINER_PLATFORM: "ecs"<br>MACKEREL_APIKEY: Mackerel API key |

cgroupfs and docker.sock mounts are no longer required.
Please see [Setting up mackerel-container-agent on Amazon ECS(default, bridge, host, none network mode)](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/install-agent/container/ecsbasic) for previous configurations.

Refer to the 'Agent configuration' section [here](https://mackerel.io/docs/entry/howto/container-agent) when using roles and plugins.

## Start monitoring

Execute the task to which mackerel-container-agent was added and start monitoring.

If this does not work, take a look at the task log.

Note that network interface metadata from other containers included in the task will not obtained.
