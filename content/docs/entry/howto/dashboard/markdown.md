Once writing is completed, create the widget by clicking the Create button.

## Markdown notation
- [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) notation can be used.
- Some extended notations of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) and/or other Markdown variants, such as tables and code blocks with syntax highlighting, are also supported.
- Some HTML tags / attributes are available. However, you can not display resources outside of Mackerel regarding `<img>` `<iframe>`.
