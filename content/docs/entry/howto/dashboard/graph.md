Next, select the graph display range. Choose from the following.

<dl>
    <dt>Enable changes</dt>
    <dd>After editing the dashboard, changes can be made to the graph display range using the controller at the top of the screen or by selecting an area of the graph.</dd>
    <dt>Specify a range relative to the current time</dt>
    <dd>Specify the length and the end of the range relative to the current time. For example, use this when you want to display a graph of the same range one year ago.</dd>
    <dt>Specify a fixed range</dt>
    <dd>Always displays a graph of the specified range.</dd>
</dl>

After your selections are complete, create the widget by clicking the Create button.
